Data-Dumper-Again version 0.01
================================

This is yet another OO interface to Data::Dumper. It is quite 
clean and damn easy to use (or will be soon).

    use Data::Dumper::Again;

    $dumper = Data::Dumper::Again->new( purity => 1 );
    $dumper->dump($scalar);
    $dumper->dump(@list);

    $dumper->dump_named( '$var' => $scalar, '*list' => \@list );
